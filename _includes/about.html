    <h2>Business Consulting</h2>
    <p>
      I offer my services to businesses.
      <br>
      Not so much to individuals - they should not need it.
      <br>
      <strong>
        - If the user needs to study how to pay you - you are doing it wrong
      </strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Bitcoin adoption will one day reach a point where users won't even need to care that they are using Bitcoin.
      Bitcoin
      will become a part of the invisible digital infrastructure around us.
      <br>
      (The infrastructure that everyone takes for granted.)</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin as Data Ledger</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is much more than money. It is the first ever truly immutable data ledger.
      <br>
      Depending on what your business does, the Data Ledger might help you for:
      <ul>
        <li>Proving the Authenticity of Documents and Events</li>
        <li>Tightening the Security of your Systems</li>
        <li>Sharing Documents with Users or Businesses</li>
        <li>Keeping a Backup of Critical Data</li>
        <li>Designing Protocols for OnChain Communication</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>The Trap of Trends</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is already decade old, yet few people actually understand what it is, and how it works. Even within the
      communities dedicated to Bitcoin, people still disagree on what Bitcoin actually is.
      <br>
      When this confusion is combined with the euphoria birthed from sudden increases of cryptocurrency prices, some
      truly
      absurd ideas get funded.
      <br>
      As a consultant, my task is not only to guide you to the good ways to use Bitcoin but also to help you stay clear
      of the bad ones.</p>
