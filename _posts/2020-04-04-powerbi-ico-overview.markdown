# ICO Overview

The intent of this report is to show how ICOs were a bad idea and how they have performed on average.

The Average ROI % is the most important metric in this report. If it goes to [-100], then the coin's value is [0]. If the ROI % is [0], then the price is the same as the price during the ICO. If it is more then [0], then the first buyers made profit.

> Warning. These values are likely to be **old**. Due to the nature of the data query behind this report, it cannot reload that data automatically. The values you see are the values from the last time I updated this data manually.
